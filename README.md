# What is Iganta?

What is Iganta? Iganta - it's application which provide instruments for improving your productivity, help you to make your goal done, track your life needs and make your life in general easier, happier. This app created with using next technologies: WPF, Entity Framework, MaterialDesign, SQLLite for local database. 
It's prototype of my idea, how Iganta has to look like. I didn't realize some of ideas which were in my mind(to do this I need to develop project from fundament and using other technologies, so it's why I didn't it), also while I created this app, I got a lot of experience and ideas for better version of it. So I decided to publish it here, see if it could be intresting for someone and create Iganta 2.0 when I'll have resources for it.
Until I create Iganta 2.0, you can try and I hope enjoy this one.

With best regards Vladislav :P
